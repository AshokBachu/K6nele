Kõnele is an Android app that offers speech-to-text services to other apps.
Many apps contain a text area or a text field (e.g. a search bar) that can be edited using
the keyboard. Kõnele provides a __speech keyboard__, which allows speech to be converted to text.
Many apps (e.g. intelligent assistants, keyboard apps, navigation apps) also contain a microphone button that
is linked to either the __standard Android speech recognition activity__
or the __standard Android speech recognition service__.
Kõnele implements both the activity and the service.

In the background, Kõnele uses two speech recognition servers.
One supports __grammar-based speech recognition__,
the other supports __continuous full-duplex speech recognition__.
Both servers focus on __Estonian speech recognition__, but both
are based on a fully open-source stack that makes them easy to deploy and customize for other
languages.

The main goals of the Kõnele project are to provide Estonian speech recognition on the
Android platform, and to provide grammar-based speech recognition for highly accurate voice command applications.
Kõnele is an open, configurable and powerful alternative to speech recognition services
currently available on Android.

  - implements [android.speech.RecognitionService](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService.html), backed by two open servers:
