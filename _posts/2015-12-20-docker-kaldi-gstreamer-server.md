To improve the speed and privacy you can set up an instance of the
[Kaldi GStreamer server](https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server) in the local network.
The [docker-kaldi-gstreamer-server](https://github.com/jcsilva/docker-kaldi-gstreamer-server) project
makes the installation very easy as all the dependencies (except for the models) are installed via Docker.
The README gives detailed instructions on how to configure KÃµnele to use the locally running server.
